# OED

The OED format was instigated by Simplitium and has been created for use as the input format to Oasis based models.                
                
It is also designed to be suitable as a model-developer-agnostic format that can be used as a basis for an insurer's exposure data repository.            
                
The work to create OED was carried out by a small working group of industry practitioners chaired by Matthew Jones with the technical work led by Aiste Kalinauskaite.            
                
The group comprised Joh Carter, James Havard, Ben Hayes, Tom Hughes, James Lay, Tristan Lloyd, Rob Porter, Matt Raywood, Marek Shafer and Tim Spencer.            
                
This work would not have been possible without the above group and their supporting organizations: Ascot, Canopius, Oasis, and Simplitium.    
                
The availability of an open code-set was extremely helpful to the development of OED. We thank AIR Worldwide for opening up their CEDE schema to the industry.   
                
OED comprises four input tables and 27 relational database tables.           
                
This spreadsheet contains the specification of each OED field for both the input tables and the database tables.   
                
Permissable values within each field (where relevant) are provided in the six 'Value' sheets.          
                
Documentation describing the OED is available at:
