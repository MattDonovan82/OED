# Open Exposure Data (OED)

The OED format was instigated by Simplitium and has been created for use as the input format to Oasis based models.                
                
It is also designed to be suitable as a model-developer-agnostic format that can be used as a basis for an insurer's exposure data repository.

The work to create OED was carried out by a working group of industry practitioners chaired by Matthew Jones with the technical work led by Aiste Kalinauskaite.               
                
The availability of an open code-set was extremely helpful to the development of OED. We thank AIR Worldwide for opening up their CEDE schema to the industry.   
                
OED comprises four input tables and 20+ relational database tables.
