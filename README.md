# Open Exposure Data (OED)

The OED format has been developed by Simplitium in collaboration with the industry as a robust and documented input framework for Oasis based platforms and models.                
                
OED is model-developer-agnostic and can be used as a basis for an insurer's exposure data repository.

The work to create OED was carried out by a working group of industry practitioners chaired by Matthew Jones with the technical work led by Aiste Kalinauskaite.               
                
The availability of an open code-set was extremely helpful to the development of OED. We thank AIR Worldwide for opening their CEDE schema to the industry.   
                
OED comprises four input tables and 20+ relational database tables.
