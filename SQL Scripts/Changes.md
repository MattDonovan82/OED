•	Added Notes columns to xCoverages, xDedtype & xGeogScheme tables

•	Currency fields changed to variable length in all tables (up to 3 characters)

•	CondPriority moved to Conditions table

•	Added additional, more granular construction codes for motor

•	Removed duplicated category for Roof cover (17 = Light Metal Panel)
